  ### Background 
  For this project we contributed to a public repo created by @JoelSmith @KylieStanley. They created a backend repo with a database storing top rated taco restaurants and the US citiies where they are located. After contributing to issues on the scrum board on thier repo page we pivoted to creating a front-end site where users could find documentation on how to consume their API.
